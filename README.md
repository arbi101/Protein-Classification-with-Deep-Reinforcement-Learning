# Protein Classification with Deep Reinforcement Learning – Phase 1

## Project Overview

This is the first phase of the project: a Django web app that allows users to submit a protein sequence in FASTA format and get predicted GO terms (Gene Ontology functional annotations). Currently, the GO terms are generated by a placeholder function (`fake_predict_go`). The app is structured to integrate a pre-trained model (e.g., DeepGO) or an external API in the future.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd Protein-Classification-with-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

Mac / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies (Django):

```bash
pip install django
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

5. Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/

Submit a protein sequence in FASTA format and press "Predict GO Terms".

## Example FASTA Input

```
>TestProtein1
MKTAYIAKQRQISFVKSHFSRQLEERLGLIEVQ
```

## Current Output (placeholder)

```
GO:0008150
GO:0003674
```

## Next Steps

- Replace the placeholder function with a DeepGO pre-trained model or an API call.
- Validate predictions with real protein sequences and benchmark performance.
- Optionally store input sequences and predicted GO terms in a database for later analysis.

## Notes

This is Phase 1 of the full pipeline for protein classification using Deep Reinforcement Learning. Phase 2 will involve HP folding in 2D and reinforcement learning to refine functional predictions.
